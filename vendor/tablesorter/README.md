### Change Log

View the [complete listing here](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/wiki/Change).

#### Version 2.7.2 (1/8/2013)

* Updated filter widget to update the filter-select when an update event is triggered. See [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/14223044/145346).
* Replaced `background-image: url();` with `background-image: none;` in all applicable theme files.

#### Version 2.7.1b (1/7/2013)

* Updated bootstrap demo
 * It now properly removes the "table-striped" class when the zebra widget is enabled.
 * The demo now uses the [`refreshWidgets` method](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/index.html#refreshwidgets) (added in v2.4) to completely remove the zebra widget.
 * Thanks to [potsky](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/111#issuecomment-11951369) for notifying me of this problem!

#### Version 2.7.1 (1/4/2013)

* Added two internal parameters to always make sure we're targeting the correct elements.
 * Added `table.config.$table` which is a jQuery object of the table.
 * Added `table.config.$tbodies` which is a jQuery object of sortable tbodies; the ones without the class name in the `cssInfoBlock` option.
* Fixed removal methods:
 * Tablesorter destroy will now properly restore the header and remove all bindings.
 * Widgets should now again be removed properly.
 * Updated the storage utility to allow setting a property to an empty string, previously it was just ignored.
* Fixed pager issues:
 * Pager status will now update properly while filtering rows.
 * Pager status will also update properly after sorting filtered rows.
 * The above issues were fixes for [issue #207](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/207).
 * Fixed the pager's `fixedHeight` option to again properly pad the table to maintain the height.

#### Version 2.7 (12/26/2012)

* Added `headerTemplate` option:
 * `headerTemplate` is a template string which allows adding additional content to the header while it is being built.
 * This template string has two default tags: `{content}` and `{icon}`.
 * `{content}` will be replaced by the current header HTML content.
 * `{icon}` will be replaced by `<i class="tablesorter-icon"></i>`, but only if a class name is defined in the `cssIcon` option.
 * Everything within this template string will be wrapped in a div with class `tablesorter-header-inner`.
 * The default template is `{content}`.
 * The following themes DO NEED the icon (`{icon}`) included in the template: Bootstrap, jQuery UI, Grey and Dropbox.
* Added `onRenderTemplate` option:
 * This is a function that is called after the template string has been built, but before the template string is applied to the header and before the onRenderHeader function is called.
 * The onRenderTemplate function receives a column index and template string parameters. The template string, from the headerTemplate option, will already have the {icon} and {content} tags replaced; it's just a string of formatted HTML. When done manipulating this string, return it.
 * Check out the [demo here](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/example-option-render-template.html).
* Updated `uitheme` widget
  * The `uitheme` setting is no longer required, use the `theme` option instead.
  * When using the `bootstrap` or `jui` theme, just add the name to the `theme` option: e.g. `theme: "bootstrap"`.
  * The `uitheme` widget option will still work, but if the theme name exists within `$.tablesorter.themes` it will override the `uitheme` option.
  * Look at the [theme demo](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/docs/themes.html) source for a better example.
* Fixed `sortReset` bug - see [issue #167](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/167).
* Fixed an issue with the pager resetting to the first page after every sort.
* Fixed javascript errors popping up when initializing the plugin on an empty table. Fixes [issue #206](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/206).
* 

#### Version 2.6.2 (12/20/2012)

* Fixed sort breaking when `tfoot` contained a table. Fixes problem mentioned in [issue #196](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/196).
* Fixed javascript error due to using `hasOwnProperty` inside of the formatFloat function in IE8. Fixes [issue #200](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/200).
* Fixed the reformatted minified widget file. Fixes [issue #201](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/201).
* Fixed pager ajax. It no longer load the initial page twice. Fixes [issue #202](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/202).

#### Version 2.6.1 (12/19/2012)

* Updated the pager
  * Added an event named `pagerBeforeInitialized` which is triggered after all of the controls have been set up, but before rendering of the table or ajax data is obtained.
  * Cleaned up pager code.
* Modifed the `formatFloat` function
  * Previously you had to call the formatFloat function with a table so it could get the number format configuration

    ```javascript
    $.tablesorter.formatFloat('1,234,567.89', table); // result if usNumberFormat true = 1234567.89
    ```

  * Now you can either pass the table or a boolean to indicate the format:

    ```javascript
    var usNumberFormat = true;
    $.tablesorter.formatFloat('1,234', usNumberFormat); // result = 1234
    $.tablesorter.formatFloat('1,234', false); // non-U.S. format result = 1.234
    ```

* Fixed pager size result incorrect with nested tables. Fixes [issue #196](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/196).
* Fixed parser javascript error when clearing tr's from table. Fixes [issue #199](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/199).
* Fixed themes so that the `sorter-false` class now restores the header padding. Mentioned in [issue #](188).

#### Version 2.6 (12/18/2012)

* Added `sortResetKey`:
  * By default, holding down the ctrl key while clicking on a header cell will reset that column's sort.
  * When sorting multiple columns, holding shift+ctrl will maintain the previous sorts and reset the selected column.
  * Thanks to [emmerich](https://github.com/emmerich) for sharing [this code](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/194)!
* Added basic unit testing:
  * JSHint checks of core, widgets and pager addon.
  * Checks of various public functions, parsers and methods.
  * This is a work-in-progress, so many more tests still need to be added.
  * See the [basic test results here](http://mottie.github.com/tablesorter/test.html).
* Sorting arrows no longer show when a header column is disabled. Fixes [issue #188](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/188).
* Improved pager AJAX support:
  * Added `serverSideSorting` option (default is `false`) to the plugin core which when `true` will disable client-side sorting.
  * Added `filter_serversideFiltering` filter widget option (default is `false`) which when `true` will disable client-side filter widget processing.
  * Added a `filterList` (`{filterList:fcol}`) ajax parameter to the pager's `ajaxUrl` option.
  * Added `cssErrorRow` option to the pager options, allowing you to style the ajax error row which only appears with ajax errors.
  * This update also fixes an issue with page size changing. See [issue #198](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/198).
  * Thanks to [dhamma](https://github.com/dhamma) for [this enhancement](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/pull/183)!
* Added `footerRow` and `footerCells` to the tablesorter themes (`$.tablesorter.themes`):
  * This allows styling of the footer in the bootstrap and jQuery UI themes.
  * Used by the `uitheme` widget.
